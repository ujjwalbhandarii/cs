/*
A member function of a class is a function that has its definition or its prototype
within the class definition like any other variable.

It operates on any object of the class of which it is a member,
and has access to all the members of a class for that object.

Member functions can be defined within the class definition or separately using scope resolution operator, : âˆ’.
Defining a member function within the class definition declares the function inline, even if you do not use the inline specifier.

only important point is that you would have to use class name just before :: operator.
A member function will be called using a dot operator (.) on a object where it will manipulate data related to that object only.
